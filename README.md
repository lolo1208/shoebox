## 🌟 Features

**LOLO' Shoebox** is built with a "Client-Side Only" philosophy. Your data (images, passwords, code) never leaves your device (unless using specific network tools like Check Host or Speed Test).

### 🛠️ Tool Categories

#### 🖼️ Image
*   **Image Converter**: Convert between JPG, PNG, WEBP, and GIF. Features quality adjustment for JPG and lossy compression with color quantization for PNG to significantly reduce file size.
*   **Image Resizer**: Change image dimensions by pixels or percentage. Supports aspect ratio locking and high-quality canvas resampling.
*   **Image Cropper**: Precise image cropping with coordinate control and preset alignments. Features a visual UI for interactive area selection.
*   **Image Slicer**: Split large images into a grid (e.g., 3x3 for social media). Automatically packages sliced files into a ZIP for download.
*   **AI Background Remover**: Powered by local AI models (`imgly-bg-removal`). Detects and removes backgrounds entirely on your GPU/CPU without uploading to any server.
*   **Image Composition**: A lightweight canvas editor. Drag and drop multiple images, rotate, scale, and adjust layers (Z-index) to create social media posters or simple designs.
*   **Watermark Generator**: Add repeating text watermarks to your images. Customize color, opacity, spacing, and rotation to protect your documents.
*   **Markdown to Image**: Render Markdown text into high-quality JPEG images. Includes syntax highlighting for code blocks and customizable styles.
*   **QR Code Generator**: Generate custom QR codes with adjustable size, foreground, and background colors.

#### 🎬 Media
*   **Audio Converter**: A full-featured audio editor in the browser. Supports trimming, volume adjustment, fade-in/out effects, and exporting to MP3, M4A, WAV, or OGG using `ffmpeg.wasm`.
*   **Video Compressor**: Locally analyzes video metadata (bitrate, tracks) and generates optimized FFmpeg commands. Perfect for creating NAS-compatible MP4 files or extreme compression for archiving.
*   **Music Tag Editor**: Fix ID3 tags for MP3 files. Search and auto-fill titles, artists, and albums from Netease, QQ Music, or iTunes. Supports embedded cover art and lyrics.

#### 文本与数据 Text & Data
*   **Date & Time**: A versatile time tool featuring Unix timestamp conversion, Solar/Lunar calendar conversion, and a duration calculator between two dates.
*   **Password Generator**: Create high-entropy secure passwords. Customize length and character types (Uppercase, Lowercase, Numbers, Symbols).
*   **UUID Generator**: Generate batches of Version 4 (Random) UUIDs or Version 5 (Namespace-based) UUIDs for consistent identity mapping.
*   **MD5 Calculator**: Compute MD5 hashes for plain text or large local files using chunked reading to prevent browser freezing.

#### 👨‍💻 Developer
*   **JSON Formatter**: More than just a beautifier. It validates, minifies, sorts keys alphabetically, and features a "Smart Repair" function to fix common JSON syntax errors.
*   **Texture Packer**: A game development essential. Packs multiple sprites into a single atlas using the **MaxRects** algorithm. Exports Cocos Creator compatible `.plist` and PNG files.
*   **Bitmap Font Generator**: Convert individual character images into a professional Bitmap Font (.fnt). Supports ASCII mapping, automatic inference, and exports in Text, XML, or JSON formats.
*   **Code Runner**: Execute snippets in 50+ programming languages online via the Piston API. Features syntax highlighting and support for command-line arguments.
*   **Easing Functions**: Visualizes common CSS/JS easing curves (In, Out, InOut). Includes interactive hover animations to preview the speed changes.

#### 🌐 Network
*   **Global Check Host**: Distributed network diagnostics. Check Ping, HTTP, DNS, and Traceroute status from multiple global nodes via Globalping API.
*   **Speed Test**: High-precision bandwidth test. Measures download/upload speeds, latency, and jitter with real-time graphical visualization.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Version 18+ recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or yarn

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**

    cd shoebox
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Setup AI Model (Important)**
    The **Background Remover** tool requires local AI model files to function offline.
    
    1.  Download the model package from:
        `https://staticimgly.com/@imgly/background-removal-data/1.7.0/package.tgz`
    2.  Extract the contents.
    3.  Create a folder named `public/models/imgly-bg-data/` in your project root.
    4.  Copy the `dist` folder from the extracted package into `public/models/imgly-bg-data/`.
    
    **Directory Structure:**
    ```text
    /shoebox
    ├── public/
    │   └── models/
    │       └── imgly-bg-data/
    │           └── dist/        <-- Contains .wasm, .onnx, .json files
    ├── src/

    ```

4.  **Run Development Server**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Open `http://localhost:5173` to view the app.
